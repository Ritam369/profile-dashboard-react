A modern, production-ready profile dashboard application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB Atlas. This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern and provides a complete solution for user authentication, profile management, and image uploads with Cloudinary integration.

## Project Structure

The application is structured following the MVC pattern for better separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)
- Cloudinary account (for image uploads)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itssoumodip/profile-dashboard-react.git
   cd profile-dashboard-react
   ```
2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - In the project root, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` for frontend variables.
   - In the `backend` folder, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` for backend variables.
   - Configure the following required environment variables:
     - Frontend: `REACT_APP_API_URL` (points to your backend API)
     - Backend: 
       - `MONGODB_URI` (MongoDB connection string)
       - `JWT_SECRET` (for JWT token signing)
       - `CLOUDINARY` related credentials

## Running the Project

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```sh
   # In the backend directory
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default
   - API endpoints will be available under `http://localhost:5000/api/`

2. **Start the frontend app (in a new terminal):**
   ```sh
   # From project root
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   - The React development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`
   - The page will automatically reload when you make changes

3. **Access the application:**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
   - The frontend will automatically connect to the backend API at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage
- Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
- Edit your profile details and upload a profile image.
- All changes are saved in MongoDB Atlas and images are stored in Cloudinary.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

1. **Frontend (root directory)**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
   ```

2. **Backend (backend directory)**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on `.env.example`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

### API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Verify authentication token
