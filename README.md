### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd profile-dashboard-react
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

REACT_APP_MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
```

### MongoDB Atlas Integration

The application is designed to work with MongoDB Atlas. To integrate with a real backend:

1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Create a cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Get your connection string
   - Create a database and collection for user profiles

2. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   The frontend expects these API endpoints:
   ```
   GET    /api/users/:id          # Get user profile
   PUT    /api/users/:id          # Update user profile
   POST   /api/users/:id/upload-image # Upload profile image
   DELETE /api/users/:id          # Delete user profile
   ```

3. **Profile Data Schema**:
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: String,
     firstName: String,
     lastName: String,
     email: String,
     phone: String,
     bio: String,
     profileImage: String,
